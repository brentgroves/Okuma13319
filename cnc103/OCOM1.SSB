OCOM1
(UPDATE MACRO 208 TO POINT TO THIS SUBROUTINE)
(ONLY EXECUTE IF COMMON VARIABLE VC40 = 1)
IF [VC40 NE 1] N10
( FORMAT OF EACH 160 BYTES OUTPUT THROUGH THE COM PORT)
( 1ST OUTPUT A HEADER CONTAINING CNC_Part_Operation_Key, A COMMA, AND SET_NO)
( 2ND OUTPUT 9 COMMON VARIABLES WHICH HAVE A FIXED LENGTH OF 10 BYTES EACH)
( THESE 10 10-BYTE BLOCKS ARE PACKED IN A UDP DATAGRAM AND SENT TO A UDP SERVER)
( 3RD OUTPUT ANOTHER HEADER, WITH SET_NO=2)
( 4TH OUTPUT 5 COMMON VARIABLES, AGAIN EACH HAVE A FIXED LEGTH OF 10 BYTES)
( AT THIS POINT 160 BYTES HAVE BEEN OUTPUT SO A WRITE COMMAND IS NEEDED)
( REPEAT THESE 4 STEPS AS MANY TIMES AS NEEDED )

    (0123456789 - ALWAYS OUTPUT 10 BYTES/CHARACTERS)
PUT '      3, 1'  (CNC_Approved_Workcenter,Set_No)
PUT VC10 (86.575MM FINISH BORE) 
PUT VC11 (ETCHING TOOL) 
PUT VC1 (TCGT 32.52 FL K10,INSERT FOR 85.24MM ROUGH BORE)
PUT VC21 (CCC-32505-100,BORING BAR FOR 85.24MM ROUGH BORE)
PUT VC12 (86.125MM ROUGH BORE)
PUT VC2 (1.25" HELLICAL MILL)
PUT VC13 (180MM DISK MILL)
PUT VC4 (HH-32503-21-AL DRILL TIP FOR 21MM DRILL)  
PUT VC44 (CCC-32503-010/PCD SPOTFACE INSERT FOR 21MM DRILL)  
(10TH 10 BYTE BLOCK, END OF 1ST DATAGRAM)
( THIS IS THE START OF THE 2ND DATAGRAM AND WILL HAVE AT MOST 6 10-BYTE BLOCKS)

PUT VC16 (135MM DISK MILL)
PUT VC7 (8.2MM DRILL)
PUT VC8 (14.3MM DRILL)
PUT VC9 (15.5MM DRILL)
