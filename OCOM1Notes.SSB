Each part that runs on a CNC needs it's own OCOMX.SSB file to run.
These files can all be loaded onto the Okuma CNC with names such as 
OCOM[1-9].SSB where the number 1 through 9 represents a the part 
specific tools to be output through the COM port.

OCOM0
IF [VC40 NE 1] N10 (Only works when VC40 = 1)
PUT '       103' (All items output are a fixed length of 10)
PUT '     61442' (Toollist processID.)
PUT VC20 (Each variable will be output with a fixed lenght of 10)
PUT VC12
PUT VC1
PUT VC10
PUT VC11
PUT VC13
PUT VC16
PUT VC7
PUT VC8
(Only 10 fixed length blocks of 10 are recieved at 1 time from Moxa to UDP server)
PUT '        2:'  (This is needed because the first variable received was less than 10 characters)
(UDP server must seek ':' character to get in sync with the 2 recieved buffer)
PUT VC9  ( Each variable after the first in the second buffer has a fixed lenght of 10)
PUT VC4
PUT VC5
PUT VC2
WRITE 0 (Only 160 characters can be output at one time.)

Each frame sent by Okuma starts with a DC2 (x12) character and
sometimes that character is in a buffer with just 1 character.
Each frame sent by Okuma is terminated with '%' (x25) and then
the DC4 (x14) character.

Lines longer than 160 characters have not been tested.

Testing:
To test changes to OCOMX.SSB do the following:
When the last tool cuts : tool 9, press op stop, 
After it's done cutting. press reset.
Reload Program.
Press cycle start.

A second way to test is by loading the OCOM0.MIN main program 
which does nothing but call the OCOMX.SSB subroutine.
